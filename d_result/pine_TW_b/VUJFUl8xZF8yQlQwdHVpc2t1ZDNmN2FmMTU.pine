// EXPLANATION OF THE STRATEGY
//The provided Pine Script implements a trading strategy that includes stop loss (SL) and multiple take profit (TP) levels,
//with an option to activate a trailing stop at the third TP level. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components and functionality:

//Variables Initialization:
var float stop = na
var float limit1 = na
var float limit2 = na

// Converts a percentage to points based on the average position price and the minimum tick size.
percent2points(percent) =>
    strategy.position_avg_price * percent / 100 / syminfo.mintick

// Stop Loss and Take Profit Inputs:
//Defines inputs for stop loss and three take profit levels in percentage terms.
sl = percent2points(input(2.92, title="stop loss %%"))
tp1 = percent2points(input(1.12, title="take profit 1 %%"))
tp2 = percent2points(input(2.31, title="take profit 2 %%"))
tp3 = percent2points(input(3.91, title="take profit 3 %%"))
activateTrailingOnThirdStep = input(false,title="activate trailing on third stage (tp3 is amount, tp2 is offset level)")

// Current Profit Calculation:
//Calculates the current profit in points based on the position size and price.
curProfitInPts() =>
    if strategy.position_size > 0
        (high - strategy.position_avg_price) / syminfo.mintick
    else if strategy.position_size < 0
        (strategy.position_avg_price - low) / syminfo.mintick
    else
        0
// Stop Loss and Profit Target Price Calculations:
//Determines the stop loss and profit target prices based on the position size and offset points.
calcStopLossPrice(OffsetPts) =>
    if strategy.position_size > 0
        strategy.position_avg_price - OffsetPts * syminfo.mintick
    else if strategy.position_size < 0
        strategy.position_avg_price + OffsetPts * syminfo.mintick
    else
        0
calcProfitTrgtPrice(OffsetPts) =>
    calcStopLossPrice(-OffsetPts)
// Current Stage Determination:
//Determines the current stage of the trade based on the profit points reached.
getCurrentStage() =>
    var stage = 0
    if strategy.position_size == 0
        stage := 0
    if stage == 0 and strategy.position_size != 0
        stage := 1

//This part of the strategy sets up exit conditions based on the current stage of the trade and uses the same exit ID "x" to modify the exit parameters dynamically.
//The exit parameters include stop loss, take profit, and comments for each stage.
// based on current stage set up exit
// note: we use same exit ids ("x") consciously, for MODIFY the exit's parameters
curStage = getCurrentStage()
float op_operation = decision_tree_0_UBER_1d_d3f7af15(bearPower, bbp, bbm, bullPower, ema3, ema12, ema1, ema2, tema, ema13)

if (op_operation <= 0)
    if curStage == 1

//SIGNAL MANAGE    User Adjustments and Risk Management
// The user can adjust the threshold values for op_operation to control the level of risk they are willing to take:
// Lower op_operation Threshold for Buy Signal (e.g., 0.5 instead of 0.55):
//     Effect: Generates more buy signals, increasing the frequency of trades. This is suitable for a user willing to take more risks and potentially capture more trading opportunities.
// Higher op_operation Threshold for Buy Signal (e.g., 0.8 instead of 0.55):
//     Effect: Generates fewer buy signals, reducing the frequency of trades. This is suitable for a user seeking to take fewer risks and only enter trades under more favorable conditions.
// Lower op_operation Threshold for Signal Closure (e.g., -0.8 instead of -0.9):
//     Effect: Closes positions less frequently, allowing trades more room to recover from temporary unfavorable conditions. This increases risk but can capture larger gains if the market reverses favorably.
// Higher op_operation Threshold for Signal Closure (e.g., -0.95 instead of -0.9):
//     Effect: Closes positions more frequently, exiting trades quickly at the first sign of unfavorable conditions. This decreases risk but may result in missed opportunities for recovery.
//Signal BUY
if (op_operation >= 0.55)
    stop := close * 0.965
    limit1 := close * 1.03
    limit2 := close * 1.02
    strategy.entry("x", strategy.long, 1, stop=stop, comment="in")
//Signal SELL
if (op_operation <= -0.9)
    strategy.close("x", comment = "under Le1")

// Impact on the Dataset
//Stop Loss (SL): Limits the maximum loss by exiting the position if the price moves against the trade by a specified percentage.
//Take Profit (TP1, TP2, TP3): Defines profit-taking levels to secure gains at different stages.
//Trailing Stop: Optionally activates a trailing stop at the third TP level to lock in profits while allowing for further gains if the price continues to move favorably.
//Position Entry and Exit: The strategy's buy and sell signals determine when to enter and exit positions, influencing the dataset by marking the points of trade execution and closure.
//Current Stage Tracking: Monitors the trade's progress through predefined stages, adjusting stop and profit levels accordingly.
//This strategy is designed to manage risk and maximize profits through a structured approach, incorporating multiple exit levels and dynamic adjustments based on market conditions. The dataset will reflect these actions, showing entries, exits, stop loss activations, and profit-taking events, providing valuable information for backtesting and performance analysis.
//Random forest AI offers significant advantages in trading, including the ability to handle large data sets, reduce overfitting and provide more robust predictions through the aggregation of multiple decision trees.
